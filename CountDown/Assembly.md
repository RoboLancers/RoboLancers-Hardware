# Assembly

There are two methods to wire the vision system. One of which is to solder all of the positive and negative 5v components together, while the other is to power the Orange Pi through an external USB C cable.  <br>

## USB C

These instructions are for assembling and wiring the CountDown Vision system using a USB C cable for powering the Orange pi.

|4x m2.5 Heatset Insert|Camera|
|3x m2.5 Heatset insert|fan|
|Solder the VRM's GND & VIN to 18AWG wires||
|Solder the VIN and GND pins to a female XT-30 connector||
|Solder VRM's VOUT & GND to a the + and ground wires respectively||
|Confirm soldering works; check continuity on each connection and ensure + and GND do not have continuity.||
|Place the Orange Pi 5 into the case||
|Test fit the top case by screwing in 4x m3 SHCS||
|Plug in the XT-30 female with a male of 12v. Ensure the Orange Pi turns on||
|Crimp the fan with a DuPont connector||
|Plug in the fan||
|Screw in the fan||
|Screw in the VRM||
|Screw on the camera||
|Clean and thermal glue the VRM's transistor||
|Clean and apply a thermal pad to the Orange Pi 5's main chip||
|Screw in the case||
|Plug in with a male xt-30 connector of 12v. Check to make sure the Red and green light are on/flashing through the air vents. Fan is blowing (should be able to feel it easily)
Camera is functional (prog) ||
