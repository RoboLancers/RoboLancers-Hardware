# RoboLancers Custom Hardware

This offseason, we've started going all out with custom hardware. Centered around issues our team has had in previous years, we've come up with our own solutions.

## Helios
Helios is a cheaper alternative to LimeLight made for April Tag detection powered with the Orange Pi 5 and ArduCam 9821, with 2 extra camera ports.

## Swerve Cover
In the offseason, we've seen that our swerve pod gears were shredded from the aluminum shavings covering the field. This swerve cover protects our swerve gears from this, in addition to housing the electronics needed more conviently.

## Standardized Din Rail Mounting
In previous years, we've had problems with mounting electronics, with each componet swap taking countless tools. Our solution is a easily removable and standardized din mount system, where components can be cliped on and off easily.
